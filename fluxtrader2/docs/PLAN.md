# fluxtrader2 — the plan

**Written 2026-09-15 from a design conversation; this is the whole plan, kept current.** When a
phase finishes, its section gets a result line and the README status row moves. Superseded
reasoning is deleted, not appended to. Parked items go in §7 with a revival trigger.

## 0. The goal, and the one-sentence strategy

**Goal:** a system that generates profitable trades on the twelve USDⓈ-M perpetual pairs the
collector records, using only that data.

**Strategy:** start at the trade end and work backwards. The cost of a trade fixes the
horizon, the horizon fixes the target, and the target fixes which kind of model can possibly
work. Build the measuring instrument before any model. Let measured ceilings, not taste, choose
the architecture, and add capacity only when a measurement says the cheaper thing left money
on the table.

## 1. What we know going in (no project conclusions, only general facts)

Read this section first if you are new to the problem; it defines the words used below.

- **Signal is weak by construction.** A market removes any regularity once it is traded, so the
  predictable part of the next few hours' return is a fraction of a percent of its variance.
  That is the opposite of the regime where large flexible models shine. Here *variance
  control* (shrinkage, averaging, few features, cleaner targets) matters more than model class.
- **Magnitude is predictable, direction barely is.** How much a price will move in the next
  hours can be forecast well from recent volatility and book depth. Which way it moves cannot,
  or only slightly. Anything that keys on magnitude (sizing, choosing when to trade) is the
  tractable half of the problem.
- **Breadth beats accuracy.** A weak edge becomes useful by being applied to many nearly
  independent bets. The usable quality of a strategy scales as skill × √(number of independent
  bets). Twelve pairs and many decision points per day is where that breadth comes from.
- **Units.** A basis point (bps) is 0.01%. "Gross" is before costs, "net" after. A "taker" order
  crosses the spread and pays the exchange's taker fee; a "maker" order rests and may not
  fill. A "round trip" is entry plus exit, so every per-trade cost below is counted twice.
- **The data.** Four years of 1m/5m/15m/1h candles on nine pairs (less on three), and about
  two months of order book, trades, funding and open interest. Details, extents and known
  defects in [DATA.md](./DATA.md). The two-month book era is *too short* to support a
  walk-forward with any statistical power on its own; it is used to calibrate cost and
  execution models, and as a check on candle-derived proxies, not as training data.

## 2. Principles (the rules this project holds itself to)

1. **Cost first.** No target or model is discussed before the cost of trading it is priced.
2. **Ceiling before model.** Every candidate bet type and horizon gets a measured
   signal-strength ceiling, a noise floor and a detectable-effect size *before* a model is fitted
   to it. A model is only fitted where the ceiling clears the cost.
3. **Registration before reading.** Every comparison that could change a decision is written
   down first: the exact contrast, the folds it reads, the gate that decides, and what we expect
   to see. Then the number is read once. No re-picking a searched dimension after seeing results.
4. **Untouched folds.** Data is split into time folds up front; the later folds are read only at
   pre-registered confirmation points, never during exploration.
5. **Power is reported with every result.** A negative result on an underpowered test is
   "not detectable", never "no effect". Every reported interval comes with the effect size the
   test could have detected.
6. **Simplest thing first, and it stays as the baseline.** A fixed rule with two or three
   parameters is the first trade generator, and every later stage must beat it out of sample
   and outside the noise floor.
7. **Capacity is earned.** A learned policy, an end-to-end model, a sequence model, or book
   features as inputs each require a prior measurement showing the cheaper stage leaves money.
8. **Everything runs in Docker, nothing on the host.** Repo-wide rule.
9. **One entry point** (README.md), one plan (this file), one data document. Results are
   recorded as result lines and tables inside these; a new document needs a reason.

## 3. Protocol (how a number becomes a decision)

- **Folds.** The candle history is cut into six contiguous 8-month folds (DATA.md "Folds",
  `ft2/folds.py`), with a 2-day embargo at the start of each scored fold. F0 is warm-up
  (training history only); F1 and F2 are the *exploration* folds; F3–F5 are *confirmation*
  folds, read only by registered contrasts. Each confirmation read is logged; a fold that has been
  read for a question cannot be reused for the same question.
- **Walk-forward.** Any fitted thing is fitted on data strictly before the window it is scored
  on, refitted per fold, and scored on the fold it has never seen.
- **Noise floor.** The same pipeline is run on labels shuffled within day, many times. A real
  result must sit outside the spread of those runs, otherwise it is unmeasured.
- **Effect size and detectable effect.** Results are per trade or per unit of notional, in bps,
  with an interval clustered by day (returns within a day are not independent). Alongside every
  interval: the minimum detectable effect (MDE) at that sample, so the reader can see whether a
  null is informative.
- **Registration file.** Each registered contrast is a short block in §8 of this document:
  name, question, contrast, folds read, gate, expectation, and, after the read, the result. Written
  before the number, dated, never edited after the read except to add the result.
- **Ledger.** Every simulated trade records the decision (what, when, why, at what size) and the
  fill (price, cost) *separately*, so that execution assumptions can be re-priced without
  re-deciding.

## 4. Phases

Each phase names its deliverable, its exact command once the code exists, and what it needs
from Vadim. Phases are serial unless stated. Times are rough and CPU-only.

### P0 — Get the data in (✅ done 2026-09-15; P0b open)

**Result 2026-09-15:** all nine collector slices exported and ingested (DATA.md has the counts and
the integrity summary: no duplicates, no interior gaps, 5m bars consistent with 1m, ~160 ms
book clock skew, ≤1.8% censored tape windows); folds fixed in `ft2/folds.py`; the public
archive's coverage measured (§9 #1) and its depth/metrics/funding files fetched for all pairs
from 2023-01-01 (`ft2 archive`). **P0b (next):** ingest `bookDepth` and `metrics` zips to
parquet (`ft2 ingest metrics` exists; depth needs its reader once the file format is inspected),
add their rows to DATA.md, and re-run `ft2 inventory`. Then P1.

**Deliverable:** one parquet per table under `fluxtrader2/data/`, a loader in `ft2.data`, and
an integrity report (row counts, extents, interior gaps, duplicate timestamps, partial-bar
check) written into DATA.md as a measured table.

- Export with `scripts/export.sh`: **5m and 1h candles over the full history** (2022-08 →
  today, all twelve pairs), and the **book-era tables** (snapshots, trades, funding, oi, lsr) from
  2026-07-01. With the VM's disk, 1m candles over the full history (23M rows) are pulled too; the raw ladder
  (`levels`) is pulled windowed only when P1's impact walk needs it.
- `ft2 ingest`: raw csv.gz → one parquet per table, typed, sorted, de-duplicated.
- `ft2 inventory`: the integrity report (extents, interior gaps, duplicates, partial-bar
  check, clock skew) written as tables into DATA.md.
- Define the folds (§3) from the measured extents and write them into DATA.md.

**Needed from Vadim:** the work VM (PLAN §6). Then Claude runs P0 on it.

### P1 — Price the trade (~1–2 sessions)

**Deliverable:** a cost table, per pair × side (taker/maker) × volatility regime, in bps per
round trip at a range of notionals (decided in P1 from the measured depth), plus a **candle-based cost proxy**
for the years that have no book.

- From the book era: quoted spread, effective spread at the touch, walked-ladder impact for a
  given notional, fill probability and adverse selection for a resting order (from the tape:
  did price trade through the resting level, and where was it N minutes later).
- Exchange fees: the venue's published taker/maker schedule, and the account's actual tier
  if an API key is available to read it. Recorded as an input with its source; never assumed.
- Proxy: fit a spread estimator that uses only candles (high/low/close based) on the book era
  where the truth is known, report its error, then apply it backwards. Without this the
  four-year history cannot be costed and P2's "does the ceiling clear the cost" has no cost.

**Needed from Vadim:** the account's fee tier (or a read-only key to fetch it).

### P2 — Ceiling audit: how much signal is there, per bet type and horizon (~2 sessions)

**Deliverable:** one table. Rows = bet type × horizon. Columns = signal ceiling, cost (from P1),
noise floor, detectable effect, sample size, verdict (fund / not detectable / excluded).

Bet types:

| bet type | what is predicted | why it is on the list |
|---|---|---|
| **directional** | sign / size of a pair's own forward return | simplest to execute; weakest, most competed |
| **cross-sectional relative value** | which pairs beat the basket over the horizon | removes the common market factor, the largest and least predictable piece of variance; twelve semi-independent bets per bar; market-neutral by construction. **Prior: highest ceiling on this data** |
| **volatility timing** | forward absolute move | not a strategy on its own; a multiplier on either of the above, measured here so its value is known |

Horizons: 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d on the 5m grid (bars of the coarser grids when it helps).

The audit itself, per target (from the design conversation; each item is a subcommand):

1. **Magnitude vs direction split** — out-of-sample R² of forward |return| vs of signed return
   from trailing volatility and a few candle features.
2. **Raw linear structure** — autocorrelation and variance-ratio tests per horizon; share of
   cross-pair variance in the first principal component (how much is "the market").
3. **Rank information coefficient (IC) screen** — Spearman correlation between each candidate
   feature and the target, per day, averaged with a t-statistic and a rolling plot. Stable
   hundredths = real weak signal; sign that flips monthly = noise or non-stationarity.
4. **Noise floor** — the intended pipeline on labels shuffled within day, walk-forward, many
   times.
5. **Learning curves** — ridge and a depth-2 boosted tree on growing windows: in-sample vs
   out-of-sample gap (variance-dominated?), slope (data-limited?), tree vs linear (interactions
   evidenced?).
6. **Effective sample size and MDE** — from residual autocorrelation and label overlap.
7. **Move vs cost** — share of bars whose absolute forward move exceeds the P1 round-trip
   cost. Bounds usable signal regardless of model.

Reads the exploration folds (F1+F2) only. **Needed from Vadim:** nothing.

### P3 — The harness (~2 sessions; can start in parallel with P2 once P0 is done)

**Deliverable:** `ft2 backtest` — walk-forward over the folds, the ledger (§3), the cost model
from P1 plugged in, the shuffled-label noise floor, day-clustered intervals with MDE, and a
registration template. Tested by feeding it a strategy with a known planted edge and checking it
is recovered with the right interval.

**Needed from Vadim:** nothing.

### P4 — The dumbest trade generator, through the harness (~1 session)

**Deliverable:** a fixed rule with ≤3 parameters for the bet type P2 funds (for relative value:
"long the bottom-decile residual, short the top, hold N bars, size by inverse volatility"), run
walk-forward, with its result, interval, noise floor and MDE. Its purpose is to be the baseline
and to prove the harness, cost model and ledger agree with each other.

Registered as a §8 block before it is run. **Needed from Vadim:** nothing.

### P5 — Forecast + analytic decision (~3 sessions)

**Deliverable:** a forecast of the forward target's distribution (ridge and a shallow boosted
tree, ensembled over seeds and training windows) and a **closed-form** decision layer: trade when
expected value exceeds cost by a margin, size by expected value over variance, capped. No learned
policy. Registered contrast: P5 vs the P4 rule on the confirmation folds.

Why the split and not one end-to-end model: the forecast learns from every bar with a
comparatively clean label; a policy trained on trade profit sees only the bars it acted on,
with execution noise added to the label. That is the wrong direction for a weak-signal problem.

**Needed from Vadim:** nothing until a result is on the table.

### P6 — Earned capacity (only on a measurement from P5)

Each of these is parked (§7) with the measurement that would fund it:

- **Learned decision layer / end-to-end model** — funded only if a registered contrast shows the
  analytic decision leaves money against an oracle sized on the same forecasts.
- **Book/tape features as inputs** — with the archive's 1-minute depth back to 2023-01 (§9 #1)
  these are testable on F1–F5 now; still funded only by a P2 ceiling reading that clears cost.
- **Sequence / deep models** — funded only if the P2 learning curve for the tree keeps rising and
  clears linear outside the noise floor.

### P7 — Paper trading, then money

Needs a serving path (a process that reads the collector's DB, decides, and records). This is
the only phase that needs an always-on host, and it is months away. Decided when P5 produces a
registered positive on confirmation folds.

## 5. Decision table (what the P2 readings mean for model choice)

| reading | choice |
|---|---|
| IC small but stable, out-of-sample R² well under 1% | ridge or shallow boosted tree, ensembled; the gain comes from breadth |
| magnitude R² high, direction near zero | separate volatility model for sizing; direction model kept minimal |
| learning curve still rising with data | extend data (more history, more pairs) before extending the model |
| IC sign unstable over time | regime detection or shorter refits, not capacity |
| tree clears linear outside the noise floor | keep the tree, add monotone constraints, stop there |
| no bet type clears cost at any horizon | more data or a different market, not a better model — and finding that out in a month is the cheapest outcome this project can have |

## 6. Infrastructure

- **Where things run (decided 2026-09-15):** a dedicated GCP VM, `fluxtrader2-work`, holds
  the data and runs every CPU job. Reason: the MacBook is short on disk, its CPU is shared, and a
  VPN toggle can kill a long download. Spec: `e2-standard-4` (4 vCPU, 16 GB), 200 GB pd-balanced
  disk, Debian 12, zone `me-central1-b` (same as the collector, so exports are VM-to-VM inside the
  region). Sizing reason: the largest frame in P0–P5 is the full-history 1m candles, about 2 GB in
  memory; CPU only matters for the repeated refits in P2/P3, and a resize (stop, change type,
  start; disk persists) takes a minute if a job turns out to be CPU-bound for hours. **Stopped when
  idle**; a stopped VM bills only its disk. Price: the Iowa list price is $0.134/h running; Doha
  is higher and was not verified on 2026-09-15 (the project's Cloud Billing API is disabled) —
  check the console's estimate when creating. Claude starts and stops it with `scripts/vm.sh`.
- **No Docker on the VM.** A plain virtualenv (`~/ft2-venv`) installed by `scripts/vm_setup.sh`,
  which is idempotent and doubles as the reinstall runbook. Reason: nothing to isolate on a
  single-purpose machine, and no image rebuild per dependency change.
- **Docker for anything local.** Quick checks on the MacBook go through `scripts/ft2.sh` and the
  Dockerfile; no host installs, ever (repo rule).
- **Code flow:** edit locally, `vm.sh push` (rsync, excludes data/ and output/), run there,
  `vm.sh pull` brings `output/` back. The VM never pushes to git.
- **Data flow:** `scripts/export.sh` runs *on the work VM* and reads the collector's Postgres
  directly over the VPC (P0 verifies the firewall and falls back to the ssh chain otherwise).
  External archives (§9) download straight to the VM.
- **Always-on host:** not needed before P7 (paper trading); that decision is P7's.
- **Deliberately not first:** any sequence model or deep network; anything trained on the book
  data alone; any reinforcement learning. Each is a capacity increase on a problem whose ceiling
  is not yet known.

## 7. Parked

| item | why parked | revival trigger |
|---|---|---|
| learned decision layer / end-to-end model | capacity not yet earned (P6) | registered P5-vs-oracle contrast shows money left on the table |
| book/tape features as model inputs | not yet measured | P2 ceiling audit on the archive's depth/flow features (2023-01 →) clears cost |
| sequence / deep models | no evidence of interactions yet | P2 learning curve: tree > linear outside the noise floor and still rising |
| 1m candles over the full history | 23M rows, not needed for horizons ≥ 15m | P1 or P2 asks for sub-15m horizons |
| paper trading (P7) | nothing to trade yet | P5 registered positive on confirmation folds |

## 8. Registrations

```

## 9. Data we could add (Vadim's offer, 2026-09-15: "we can download/build whatever possible")

Ranked by what it unlocks. Indicators are *not* on this list: anything computed from candles is
built here in P2 and needs no download.

| # | data | source | what it unlocks | phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Historical book depth, tape and flow for the same twelve pairs** | Binance's public archive (`data.binance.vision`, USDⓈ-M futures; free, no key). **Coverage measured 2026-09-15:** 1-minute book depth at ± price levels (`bookDepth`) **2023-01-01 → today** for every pair (from listing for the younger ones), ~0.5 MB/day/pair; 5m open interest + long/short + taker ratios (`metrics`) 2020-09 → today; the full tape (`aggTrades`) 2019-12 → today, ~5 MB/day for BTC; funding monthly since 2020. Best bid/ask (`bookTicker`) was discontinued in 2024 — `bookDepth` covers it. 1m klines back to 2019-12 (2.7 years more than the collector holds). | The single biggest gap in our data was that book, tape and flow existed for two months while candles existed for four years. This closes it back to 2023-01: P1's cost model is measured over 3.7 years instead of proxied, and book/flow features (§7) become testable in a powered walk-forward over F1–F5. **Fetched in P0** (`ft2 archive`: bookDepth, metrics, fundingRate, all pairs, 2023-01-01 →); the tape waits for P1's fill study. | P0 → P1, P2 |
| 2 | **Candles for a wider universe** (the top ~30–50 USDⓈ-M perps by volume, 5m and 1h) | same archive | Breadth: the plan's edge comes from many semi-independent bets, and a cross-sectional strategy on twelve names is thin. More names also gives a cleaner "market" factor. The collector need not record them for research; only for trading later. | P2 (ceiling audit on 12 vs 40) |
| 3 | **Spot klines for the same symbols** | same archive (spot) | Basis (perp minus spot) and its changes, a known carry/flow signal; also a cleaner index for the market factor | P2 |
| 4 | **Same pairs on a second venue** (Bybit / OKX perps, 1m klines) | their public archives | Cross-venue lead-lag at short horizons; only relevant if P2 funds a sub-15m horizon | parked |
| 5 | On-chain, news, sentiment | various | Low prior at these horizons, high engineering cost; not now | parked |

Rule for adding any of them: a raw download lands under `data/raw/external/<source>/`, is
ingested by `ft2 ingest` into its own parquet, and gets a row in DATA.md with its measured
extent and its integrity check before any phase reads it.
